### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3


### What I learned

I learned that you can use another CSS section right inside the style sheet. I refrenced my '.container' within my media query so it could adjust the container to whatever screen device your using. 

## Continued development

From here going forward i'd like to better identify the common layout for most projects. Get familiar with the broad details of flex over grid. 

## Acknowledgments:

I definitely give credit to Frontend Mentor program in total. It is very helpful having all the different solutions to review and implement in my code. I am still learning very much everyday and I look forward to noticing patters and can completley take the reigns all on my own.
